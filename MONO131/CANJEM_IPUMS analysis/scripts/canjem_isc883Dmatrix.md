*This script 1. creates CANJEM ISCO88_3D for Cobalt, Antimony and
Tungsten according to various constraints and 2.evaluates each job in
the CANJEM databases as “exposed”, “unexposed” , “unknown”.*

The table below describes the state of the ISCO68 to ISCO683D crosswalk
as applied to the CANJEM population. “low resolution” was excluded
because the ISCO codes in the crosswalk were 2-digit codes

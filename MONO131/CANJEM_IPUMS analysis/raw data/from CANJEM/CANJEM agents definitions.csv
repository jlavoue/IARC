110001,"Abrasives dust","Dust generated from abrasives during the manufacturing of abrasives or during abrading, smoothing, or polishing of metals, wood, stones, concrete, jewelry, etc.  The abrasive could be of a single composition such as silica, or aggregate material containing alumina or silicon carbide, with binders such as vitrified glass, resins or rubber.  "
110002,"Inorganic insulation dust","Dust arising from the placement or removal of any inorganic heat insulating materials including asbestos (chrysotile or amphibole), mineral wool, glass fibers and vermiculite/perlite.  "
110005,"Metallic dust","Any metal dusts generated, regardless of the specific metals involved or whether they are known or unknown.  Most metals will have undergone a certain amount of surface oxidation but exposure to specific metal oxides (e.g., lead oxides; iron oxides) was coded only when the main exposure was to the oxide itself and not to the metal dust.  "
110007,"Chrysotile asbestos","Naturally occuring fibrous hydrated silicates.  Asbestos fibers can be divided on the basis of mineralogical features into two groups: serpentines and amphiboles.  Chrysotile fibres are curly serpentine fibers made up of tiny individual fibrils which take the shape of a spirally wound tube.  Chrysotile asbestos is the type most used for textiles, friction materials (e.g. brake and clutch linings) and floor tiles.  "
110008,"Amphibole asbestos","Naturally occuring fibrous hydrated silicates.  Asbestos fibers can be divided on the basis of mineralogical features into two groups: serpentines and amphiboles.  The amphibole fibers are straight and needle-like silicate structures generally more brittle than chrysotile asbestos fibers.    "
110009,"Cristalline silica","The crystalline forms of free silica are quartz, cristobalite and tridymite.  Many sands, clays and rocks are largely composed of small silica crystals; exposure to silica occurred mainly because of sand used in construction, in sand blasting, in foundry molds, clay, glass and stone processing, pottery and brick making.  Exposure also occurred to workers involved in mining, quarrying, and rock and soil drilling.  "
110010,"Portland cement","A powder that can be made into a paste by the addition of water, used in construction for bonding bricks, concrete blocks and stone and for producing concrete slabs, pipes, etc.  It consists of about 75% calcium silicates, 5-10% calcium aluminates, 5% calcium sulphate, 5 to 10% calcium-aluminium-iron compounds and 1 to 4% oxides of sodium, potassium and magnesium.  "
110011,"Glass dust","Glass is an inorganic product of fusion which has cooled to a rigid solid without undergoing crystallization.  The properties of glasses are determined by their chemical composition and since this can vary infinitely, there are thousands of different glasses available.  Potential exposures have been in the construction industry (cutting and installing glass doors and windows) and during grinding, buffing or polishing of optical lenses, prisms, and reflective optics. "
110012,"Glass fibres","Manufactured from the raw ingredients of glass but with processes designed to create fibrous material.  These filament fibers have been used mainly as insulators, as plastic reinforcing materials and in special textiles.  "
110013,"Industrial talc","Talcs are hydrated magnesium silicates.  Depending on where it is mined, commercially available industrial talc is very often geologically associated with other minerals including carbonates, quartz and varying amounts of asbestos minerals (amphiboles and serpentine) in the form of chains or fibres.

110016,"Concrete dust","Dust generated by the cutting, polishing or breaking of concrete which consists of Portland cement, sand, gravel or crushed rock and water.  Cast concrete is placed in forms, in a wet state, at the point of use at the construction site and allowed to harden into the form of beams, floor slabs and walls. "
110017,"Refractory brick dust","Dust generated by cutting or breaking of refractory bricks.  These bricks are used to withstand the effect of thermal, chemical and physical extremes met within furnaces during standard operating procedures.  Although silica and fire-clay bricks are the most widely used, alumino-silicate, basic or other refractories are included.  The steel industry has been the largest consumer of refractory bricks for the lining of blast furnaces, stoves, open hearths and other furnaces.  Other industrial uses include foundries, pottery kilns, boilers and glass furnaces.  "
110018,"Bronze dust","Dust generated when objects made of bronze are cut, abraded, machined, polished, etc.  The term bronze is generally applied to any copper alloy where tin is the other major alloying element, although small amounts of other elements are added to modify the characteristics of the bronzes.  The product obtained by adding tin to copper is more fusible than copper and thus better suited for casting.  "
110019,"Brass dust","Dust generated when objects made of brass are cut, abraded, machined, polished, etc.  Brasses are the most widely used alloys of copper.  They are fundamentally binary alloys of copper with zinc but often their properties are modified by addition of other elements in small amounts.

Other uses have included match manufacture, vulcanization of rubber, bleaching agent of paper pulp and wool, and as an agricultural insecticide. "
112001,"Calcium oxide","Also known as lime, calcium oxide is produced by calcining limestone (calcium carbonate).  Large amounts of lime (or hydrated lime, Ca(OH)2, which was also coded here) have been used in pulp and paper making, as a soil treatment in agriculture and as a 'whitewash' to coat stables, dairies and other farm buildings.  It has also been used in masonry mortars, plasters, stucco, and unhairing of skins in leather manufacturing.   "
112002,"Calcium sulphate","Also known as gypsum, calcium sulphate is a widely distributed naturally occurring mineral.  It has been used to produce gypsum wallboard which consists of a core of gypsum sandwiched between two layers of paper.  Other uses have been as dental plasters for making tooth impressions, orthopedic plasters, pottery plasters, lamp bases, and patching compounds.  "

It has been used as a flux in the melting of iron, as a filler in asphalt, putty, crayons, paints, rubber, plastics and linoleum, for writing on blackboards and as a mild abrasive in polishes.  "
112201,"Titanium dioxide","This extremely dense, powerful opaque white inorganic pigment has great hiding power.  It is absolutely inert and therefore permanent.  The best quality is produced from ilmenite.  It has been used as a pigment in paints, paper, plastics, floor coverings, inks, rubber, ceramics, roofing granules, textiles and as a fluxing agent in welding electrodes.  "
112601,"Iron oxides","All oxides of iron (e.g., Fe3O4, Fe2O3, FeO.Fe2O3).  The most important uses of these compounds have been in pigments for plastics, leather, bricks, textiles, paper and concrete products.  Exposure to iron oxides is widespread; this also includes exposure to rust. "
113001,"Zinc oxide","A white, water insoluble powder widely used as a pigment and accelerator in paints and rubbers. In paints it resists the action of ultraviolet light and atmospheric sulphur, and prevents growth of mildew and fungus.  Other uses include insulating compounds, sunscreen lotions, and paper coatings.  "
118201,"Lead oxides","All oxides of lead.  Red lead (Pb3O4), and litharge (PbO) which is the yellow lead monoxide, have been used extensively as pigments in paints to protect steel substrates against corrosion.

140002,"Wool fibres","Dust generated during carding, spinning, weaving, knitting, cutting, sewing, and handling of wool or wool-containing textiles.  Wool fibers are produced from the hair of sheep or of other animals (goats, llamas).  These natural fibers are often blended with synthetic fibers (e.g., acrylic fibers) to make up yarn or textiles.  They are often treated with starches, dyes, inks, sizing or other finishing materials, some of which were coded separately.  "
140003,"Silk fibres","Dust generated when spinning, weaving, cutting, sewing or handling of silk or silk-containing textiles.  Silk is a lustrous, tough elastic fiber produced by the larvae of silkworms; the term also covers the thread or cloth made from this fiber.

The textile may have been treated with starches, dyes, inks, sizing or other finishing materials which may have been coded separately.  "
140009,"Cork dust","Cork is obtained from the bark of the cork oak tree, Quercus suber, which is found in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Algeria, and to a limited extent in the U.S.  The natural outer layer ends up as bottle cork, cork paper for cigarette tips, and floats for rafts and nets.  Reconstituted cork is ground into particles and bonded together with an adhesive to produce floor coverings and panels (corkboard) and special sections for thermal and acoustic insulation.  "
140010,"Hair dust","Hair is found as a covering and protection on bodies of nearly all mammals, including man.  Hair dust was coded for exposure to human hair and to the hair of non fur-producing animals such as cattle, horses, pigs and goats.  "
140012,"Starch dust","Starch is a soft, white, odorless powder produced from grains such as corn, wheat, rice, potatoes and yams.  Starches have been widely used in foodstuffs, adhesives, textile and paper sizing, gelling and thickening agents, and fillers.  They have also been used in mining as flocculating agents, in the manufacture of explosives and many chemicals, and as carriers for pigments, inks and dyes. "

Felt is a fibrous material obtained through the interlocking of wool, fur or hair fibers under conditions of heat, moisture and friction to form an unwoven densely matted fabric.  It has been used for hats, padding and lining of instrument cases, insulation, and sound and vibration absorption.  "
140016,"Leather dust","Dust generated from skins and hides of animals after they have been cured or tanned by the action of oils, or chemically acted upon by tannins.  Leather dust consists of the light, fluffy fibers blown from the buffing and sueding wheels in tanneries or in leather product industries.  "
140017,"Tobacco dust","Tobacco is produced from the plant of the genus Nicotiana; it has been used for smoking and chewing, tobacco snuff, as an insecticide, and for production of nicotine. Tobacco dust exposure mainly occurred during the manufacture of cigars, cigarettes, pipe or chewing tobacco or snuff, and to some extent to tobacco farmers.  "
140018,"Natural rubber","Obtained by tapping the bark of the rubber tree and coagulating the milky latex.  The rubber is then masticated and blended with various other ingredients such as pigments, vulcanization agents, accelerators, antioxidants, and plasticizers.

"
150010,"Nylon fibres","The first truly synthetic fiber, nylon is a manufactured fiber in which the fiber forming substance is any long-chain polyamide having recurring amide groups (R-CO-NH-) as an integral part of the polymer chain.  Nylon (polyamide) fibers should not be confused with polyamide resins which were coded separately.  Type 6 and 6/6 nylon dominate the textile fiber field.  More than 60% of the total volume of nylon fibers produced is used in home furnishings, mostly carpets and upholstering.  It has also been used in clothing, especially water-resistant outerwear, sweaters, and hosiery.  "
150011,"Acetate fibres","These synthetic fibers, introduced in the mid 1920s, are made up of cellulose acetate, a chemical derivative of the naturally occurring polymer cellulose.  Included are both types of fibers:  acetate, made from partially hydrolyzed cellulose and triacetate, fibers that are fully acetylated. These fibers are mostly used in wearing apparel (women's clothing, undergarments and linings).  "
150012,"Cellulose acetate","Cellulose acetates (di- and tri-) are prepared by acetylating cellulose. They have been used mainly in adhesives, varnishes (for aircraft canvas in the past, for instance), photographic films, and various molded, extruded or blown plastic objects such as toys.  They have also been used to make textile fibers, but these were coded separately (see acetate fibers).  Cellulose acetate butyrate was also coded as cellulose acetate since in many cases it was hard to distinguish between the two resins.  "
150013,"Cellulose nitrate","A thermoplastic resin made by treating cellulose (cotton linters) with a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids.  Cellulose will unite with 1 to 6 molecules to make two types of cellulose nitrate which are both coded under this rubric.  The lower nitrates are used for plastics and coatings and the higher nitrates, known as nitrocellulose, for explosives.  "
150014,"Polyethylene","Two types of these thermoplastic (can be softened on re-heating) resins were inlcuded in this category: high density (mainly branched polymers) and low density (mainly linear polymers).  Polyethylene, also known as Polythene®, has been used mainly as packaging film (mostly low density), in plastic bags, various plastic bottles and containers (mostly high density), toys, pipes and wire and cable insulation.  "
150015,"Polypropylene","First produced in 1954, this resin surpasses polyethylene in many fields because of its higher thermal operating range.  Typical applications include textile fibers, packaging, bottles, and housewares.  The fibers produced have been mainly used in indoor-outdoor carpeting and in upholstery fabrics.  "
150016,"Polystyrene","This definition applies to general purpose and high impact polystyrene polymers (used in high heels, for example) as well as to polystyrene foam (Styrofoam®, used in coffee cups, meat trays, or thermal insulation products).  SBR rubber (styrene-butadiene rubber) and ABS plastics (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene plastics) were coded separately.  "
150017,"Poly(vinyl chloride)","The general formula for pure PVC is (CH2CHCl)n but some copolymers with polyvinyl acetate are also coded here.  The principal markets for these thermoplastic resins have been plumbing pipes and fittings, toys, packaging, flooring, and coatings.  "

150020,"Polyacrylates","Thermoplastic resins produced by polymerization of the esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid.  The most important resin is polymethylmethacrylate (sheet plastic produced with this resin is commonly know as plexiglassTM).  First produced commercially in 1931, acrylic plastics have been widely used as a substitute for glass and for dental prosthesis.  Acrylic resins have also been widely used in coatings, most notably in water-based trade sale paints and in motor vehicle paints.  "
150022,"Alkyds","Thermosetting oil-modified polyester resins made by the esterification of a polybasic acid with a polyhydric alcohol;  the resins are reacted with oils, fatty acids, or other resins.  They have been used extensively in solvent-based coatings (especially trade sale paints) and in printing inks.  "
150023,"Epoxies","Thermosetting synthetic resins characterized by a highly strained triangular ring consisting of an oxygen atom bonded to two adjoining and bonded carbon atoms.  They are usually made by reacting epichlorohydrin with polyhydroxy compounds (very often bisphenol A).  Excellent mechanical and electrical properties have made these resins very useful in adhesives, resistant coatings and electrical insulating materials.  "
150024,"Phenol-formaldehyde","Thermosetting resins prepared by reacting phenol with formaldehyde; they are among the oldest of the synthetic plastic materials, dating back to 1909.  They have been widely used in adhesives (especially outdoor plywood bonding), foundry molds and cores (as a binder for sand), brake linings (as a binder for the asbestos fibers), coatings (electrical insulating varnishes), resin-bonded grinding wheels, laminates, thermal and acoustical insulation materials (as a binding agent for glass fibers or mineral wool), and in castings.  "
150025,"Urea-formaldehyde","These resins are among the most widely used of the amino resins (resins produced by the addition reaction between formaldehyde and such compounds as urea, melamine, aniline, ethylene, sulphonamide).  They are used extensively as plywood and particleboard adhesives, especially for indoor use (furniture particleboard, indoor use plywood).  In the past they were also used for imparting wrinkle recovery to cellulosic fabrics but have been gradually replaced by melamine resins.  Urea-formaldehyde resins are still widely used in molded plastics (especially electrical wall plates and connectors, lighting fixtures and reflectors) and in oven-cured industrial finish coatings (porcelain-type finish). "
150026,"Melamine-formaldehyde","Melamine (C3N3(NH2)3) and formaldehyde react to form these thermosetting resins which are widely used in laminating, molding, and bonding formulations, sometimes supplanting urea resins which are less resistant to humidity.  They have also been used for textile (permanent press finishes) and paper treatments, for plastic dinnerware, and as laminated plastic sheets for counters and tabletops.  "
150027,"Polyurethanes","Generally considered to cover all products of reaction between isocyanates and polyhydroxy compounds.  These resins have been used in a great variety of products: rigid and flexible foam products, hard and soft plastic products, elastomers, paints, varnishes, and adhesives.  "
150028,"Polyester resins","Most textbooks would state that an unsaturated polyester is formed by reacting a dihydroxy alcohol (mostly propylene glycol) with an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or anhydride (mainly phthallic or maleic anhydride).  The unsaturation permits cross-linking with a vinyl monomer (mostly styrene).  This category was coded mainly to workers exposed to the final product containing the polyester resin already cross-linked with styrene and usually reinforced with glass fibers. Isocyanates can also be used to cross-link certain polyester polymers and the resulting product will then be a polyurethane and was coded as such;  polyester resin was not coded in this case. Polyester resins began to be used commercially in the mid 50s, mainly in construction laminates, in boats and other marine uses, in castings (non-reinforced polyester), in swimming pools, and in reservoirs.  "
150029,"Styrene-butadiene rubber","SBR is a copolymer of 1,3-butadiene and styrene (with butadiene furnishing at least 50% of the polymer units).  It is a general purpose rubber often blended with natural rubber. Tire manufacturing represents the largest single rubber application and the largest end use of SBR rubber.  Water-based trade sale paints were formulated with SBR in the early 50s.  "
150030,"Polychloroprene","The world's entire production of chloroprene (CH2=CClCH=CH2) is used in the manufacture of polychloroprene latex and rubber (also called neoprene).   These elastomers have been widely used in synthetic adhesives, mainly solvent-based contact cements. Their excellent resistance to oils, chemicals, and sunlight have also led to their use in a variety of rubber products such as conveyer belts, footwear, hose covers, and wire coverings.  "
160001,"Fabric dust","Dust generated during carding, spooling, weaving, spinning, cutting, and handling of treated or untreated fibers and fabrics made of either natural or synthetic fibers. Treated textile fibers and fabrics have undergone chemical processes often referred also as “textile finishing” such as sizing, fire-proofing, water-proofing, chintzing, mercerizing, crease-resisting, etc… Treated fabrics may also contain pigments used to print or dye.  Those and other finishing materials may contribute to the toxicity of the dust of fibers and textile fabrics."
170001,"Coal dust","Coal is composed mainly of carbon with smaller amounts of hydrogen, nitrogen,  oxygen, sulphur and other organic aromatic compounds. In the past, it was used primarily as a fuel.  The greatest exposure to coal dust occurs among miners and others who handled it in its raw form.  "
170002,"Carbon black","An amorphous powdered carbon resulting from the incomplete combustion of liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons in a limited air supply.  It contains essentially 88 to 95% elemental carbon, 0.4 to 11% oxygen and 0.05 to 0.8% hydrogen.

Furthermore, concentrations of PAHs may increase in some of these products during use (e.g., used motor oils).  "
530197,"PAH's from coal","Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a group of chemicals made up of three or more benzene rings interlinked in various arrangements.  They are naturally present in fossil fuels or can be formed by thermal decomposition of any organic material containing carbon and hydrogen.  The most important sources of PAHs (in terms of quantity of PAHs released on a weight percent basis) in the workplace are coal tar products.  Coal tar products are used at high temperatures in many industrial processes such as aluminium smelting and iron and steel production, thereby emitting PAHs into the work atmosphere.  "
530198,"Benzo[a]pyrene","A number of five and six-membered ring PAHs are regarded as being carcinogenic and among these, benzo(a)pyrene, a six ring compound, has been the subject of special interest.  It is the most frequently studied PAH and analytical methods for its determination have been available for a long time;  in fact, determination of the benzo(a)pyrene exposure has often been used as a proxy for PAH exposure.  The highest concentrations of benzo(a)pyrene occur in coal tar products. "
530199,"Mononuclear aromatic hydrocarbons","MAHs are those hydrocarbons that possess the special properties associated with the benzene nucleus or ring, in which six carbon-hydrogen groups are arranged at the corners of the hexagon.  This includes all aromatic compounds that have only one benzene ring including substituted products such as xylene, toluene, styrene (all of which were also coded separately), phenol and ethyl benzene and others.  These substances are present in certain petroleums, solvents, motor and heating fuels and coal tar distillates. "
530299,"Aromatic alcohols","Includes all phenolic derivatives such as phenol itself (which was also coded separately), hydroquinone (a reducing agent in photographic developing baths), o-phenyl phenol (contained in Lysol®), hexachlorophene (Phisohex®, an antibacterial detergent used in hospitals), pyrocatechol (an antioxidant in rubber) and resorcinol (used in tanning).  Creosote (also coded separately), obtained from coal tar, also contains a small amount of phenol.  "
530399,"Aromatic amines","Aromatic hydrocarbons in which at least one hydrogen atom has been substituted by a primary, secondary or tertiary amino group.  The main compounds coded here are aniline, benzidine and naphtylamines.  Other chemical groups may also be present on the aromatic ring.  Many dyes and organic pigments contain the aromatic amine function.  "
531799,"Phthalates","Because of their low vapor pressures and chemical stability, various esters of phthalic acid such as diethyl, dibutyl, and di-n-octyl are used as plasticizers to impart flexibility to certain plastics, notably polyvinyl chloride or PVC.  "
531899,"Isocyanates","Represented by the general formula R-N=C=O, these are basic constituents in the production of polyurethanes, which in turn are used as flexible and rigid foams, and in resins, paints and varnishes.  Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) is the most commonly used of the isocyanates but all other types were included.  "
890001,"Ionizing radiation","A form of energy capable of penetrating matter and causing ionization along its path.  Includes X-rays, gamma rays, alpha and beta particles and neutrons.  X-ray machines, nuclear reactors and particle accelerators are sources of occupational exposure.  "
890002,"Radio frequency, microwaves","Radio and microwave radiation occupy the middle portion of the known electromagnetic spectrum.  Their frequencies range from 300 KHz to 300 GHz with microwave generally referring to those above 300 MHz.  Some important sources include radar systems used for tracking and guiding purposes as well as transmitters used in satellites.  Exposure has also occurred in radio and television broadcasting, wood and paper drying, plastic curing, food processing, medical treatment, biochemical analysis, burglar alarms and microwave ovens (both those used for cooking and for other industrial applications).  "
890003,"Ultraviolet radiation","The ""non-ionizing"" radiation portion of the spectrum that lies between the X-rays and visible spectrum.  Apart from natural solar ultraviolet radiation, other sources include incandescent, fluorescent, and discharge types of light sources and welding operations.  "
990005,"Cleaning agents","Materials which have cleansing action such as soap.  Their main function is to aid water in the cleaning process.  They may be simple sulphonated fatty acids or complex synthetic materials.  Organic solvents were excluded here and have been coded separately.  "
990013,"Fertilizers","Materials that are added to the soil to supply plant food either directly or by chemical reaction with the soil.  Commercial fertilizers include nitrates, phosphates, potash salts, calcium salts or mixtures of these.  "
990014,"Pesticides","Substances capable of killing some form of organism that is deemed to be undesirable.  Pesticides include insecticides, herbicides, rodenticides, fungicides, molluscicides and nematodicides.  Farming is the main occupation in which pesticides are used in large quantities, and are likely to be handled in an unsafe manner.  "
990021,"Biocides","Includes all products used to disinfect, deodorize, sterilize and sanitize.  This implies the capability of killing micro-organisms (algae, bacteria, viruses, etc.).  This group therefore includes bactericides, algicides, fungicides, germicides and preservatives.  Agricultural pesticides were coded separately.  "
990022,"Bleaches","Substances or mixtures which have the ability to chemically remove dyes or pigments that exist naturally in a material or that have been added to it in an industrial process.  They are widely used in the treatment of cellulose, in the pulp and paper industry and of course in the textile industry.  The main active agents found in bleaches include chlorine, calcium hypochlorite, potassium hypochlorite, sodium hypochlorite (Javex), chlorine dioxide, sodium chlorate, hydrogen peroxide and detergents (several of which have also been coded separately).
